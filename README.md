For my CS-2 (Introduction to datastructures) class at Caltech, Annabel Reyna and I implemented a back-end map that obtains shortest routes between various points. The datastructures utilized here are entirely original (array and linked deque, N-gram map, trie map, chaining-hash-dictionary, priority queue, move-to-front dictionary, heap) and the algorithms used include the dfs, djikstra, and topological-k-sort.
